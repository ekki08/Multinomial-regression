# Multinomial Regression Project

This project explores multinomial logistic regression to predict categorical outcomes with more than two classes. Using [your dataset name/description], the model identifies key factors that influence class membership and estimates probabilities for each possible category.

The project demonstrates:

1. Data preprocessing and feature engineering
2. Building and evaluating a multinomial regression model
3. Interpreting coefficients and predicted probabilities
4. Visualizing results for better insights

Built with Python, Scikit-learn/Statsmodels, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
