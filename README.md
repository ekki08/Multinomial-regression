ðŸ“Œ Multinomial Regression Project

This project explores multinomial logistic regression to predict categorical outcomes with more than two classes. Using [your dataset name/description], the model identifies key factors that influence class membership and estimates probabilities for each possible category.

The project demonstrates:

Data preprocessing and feature engineering

Building and evaluating a multinomial regression model

Interpreting coefficients and predicted probabilities

Visualizing results for better insights

Built with Python, Scikit-learn/Statsmodels, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
